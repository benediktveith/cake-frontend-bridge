## Bake JS Controllers

You can bake JS Controllers for your controller actions by using the bake shell. Just pass the controller name and the camelized action name.

    bin/cake bake js_controller Posts addPost

This command will create the JS controller file and if necessary the directory structure for it.

You can also bake JS controllers into your plugins by using the `--plugin` option.
